## Introduction
This is an analysis of an imaginary store called the **ABC Supermarket** that I completed recently. The project involves data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization to derive actionable insights and answer crucial questions in order to help the store make data driven decisions, using Microsoft Excel. This project has helped to enhance my data analytics skills.
